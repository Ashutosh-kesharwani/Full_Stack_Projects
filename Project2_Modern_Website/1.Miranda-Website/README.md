# 🎨 Miranda — A Modern Creative Landing Page

**Miranda** is a visually immersive and animation-rich website that blends **modern design, minimal aesthetics, and smooth motion** to deliver a cinematic front-end experience.  
This project is part of my **creative landing page series**, where I explore the art of motion, typography, and storytelling in web design.

## 🪄 Concept & Inspiration

The goal behind **Miranda** was simple — create a landing page that feels alive.  
Instead of static layouts, every scroll and transition in Miranda is designed to **flow naturally** and tell a story through **motion and contrast**.

Inspired by **modern creative agencies**, this page focuses on:
- Subtle textures & elegant color tones  
- Typography-driven hero sections  
- Layered animations that create visual rhythm

## ✨ Design Highlights

- 🎬 **GSAP Timeline Magic** — smooth, cinematic animations synced perfectly  
- 💫 **Layered Visual Depth** — overlapping image and text transitions  
- 🧭 **Modern Layout Structure** — balanced grid with fluid composition  
- 🎨 **Typography Focus** — bold use of `Monument Extended` font  
- 🌈 **Neutral Color Palette** — calm beige tones with minimal contrast  
- ⚡ **Animated Navigation** — engaging menu interactions & scroll reveals

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Creating **multi-element motion** using `GSAP.timeline()`  
- Leveraging **ScrollTrigger** for scroll-based reveals  
- Perfecting **timing and easing curves** (`Expo.easeInOut`)  
- Designing for **both aesthetics and performance**  
- Structuring animations for reusability and scalability
