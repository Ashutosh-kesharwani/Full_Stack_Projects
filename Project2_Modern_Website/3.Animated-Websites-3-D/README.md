## 🧩 Project 1 — 3D Animated Website #1
### 🖼️ Overview
This website demonstrates a **scroll-synced 3D animation effect** built entirely with:
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** for animation control  
- **Locomotive Scroll** for smooth scrolling  
- **HTML5 Canvas** for image-sequence rendering  

As the user scrolls, **117 frames of images** are played dynamically on the canvas to simulate a **3D rotational or cinematic animation effect**, seamlessly integrated into the landing page.

---

### ✨ Key Features
- 🎞️ Canvas-based frame-by-frame animation (117 `.webp` frames)
- 🧭 Smooth scrolling powered by **Locomotive Scroll**
- ⏱️ Scroll-synced animation using **GSAP ScrollTrigger**
- 📱 Fully responsive and performance-optimized
- 🎨 Clean, modern design with layered 3D feel
- ⚡ Real-time resizing of the canvas with maintained aspect ratio
- 🔁 Scroll pinning for immersive animation playback
