🎨 3D Animated Websites — Modern Web Design Series

This repository showcases two advanced 3D animated websites, each exploring unique approaches to depth, motion, parallax, and cinematic web interactions using modern web technologies like GSAP and Locomotive Scroll.

Both projects are part of my Modern Web Design Series and demonstrate my ability to build high-performance, scroll-driven 3D web experiences.
